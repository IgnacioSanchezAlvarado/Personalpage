<p> The Granny Smith, also known as a green apple or sour apple, is an apple cultivar which originated in Australia in 1868.[1] It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the domesticated apple Malus domestica as the polleniser.[citation needed]

The fruit is hard, firm and with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The flavour is tart and acidic. It remains firm when baked, making it a popular cooking apple[2] used in pies, where it can be sweetened. The apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe.[3] The US Apple Association reported in 2019 that the Granny Smith was the third most popular apple in the United States of America.[4]</p>
