<p> <Strong>Main Characteristic:</strong></p>

<p> Fuji apples are typically round and range from large to very large, averaging 75 millimetres (3.0 in) in diameter. They contain between 9â€“11% sugars by weight and have a dense flesh that is sweeter and crisper than many other apple cultivars, making them popular with consumers around the world. Fuji apples also have a very long shelf life compared to other apples, even without refrigeration. With refrigeration, Fuji apples can remain fresh for up to a year.[4]</p>
